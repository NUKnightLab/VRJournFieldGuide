# What is a game engine?
A game engine is a piece of software that provides patterns and abstractions that
make it faster and easier to create content. While they have the word "game" in the
name, game engines can be useful tools for creating anything from models of buildings
to 360 video projects. As of this writing, the two major game engines VR content
producers are using are [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4). Both Unity and Unreal
are available to download for free. For the duration of this tutorial, we'll be focussing
on Unity.

#What does Unity get me?
Unity provides patterns and tooling to support your development process, but the
biggest benefit of using one of the big game engines is the community it provides.
There's a really robust library of tutorials (I recommend [Space Shooter](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial)), provided both by Unity and independent
developers, as well as a ton of assets, many of which are available for free, that
can be accessed through the Unity Asset Store.

#Setup to deploy to an Android phone
The first thing you'll want to do is download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and follow the installation instructions. If you're working on a Mac, you'll also need to make sure you have [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/).

Next, make sure your phone can receive USB transfers. This was a little trickier than I expected it to be.
With my phone plugged in, I pulled down the status bar so that my screen looked like this:
