# What VR should I be watching?
This page is for noteworthy projects that explore storytelling in VR. Seen something
great recently? Add a link and leave a quick review.

##How do I even watch VR?
The easiest way is to download an app and pop your phone into a Google Cardboard
(we have a couple in the Lab you can try out). Here are a few apps that might be of
interest:

  * [NYTVR](http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/nytvr/)
  * [With.in](http://with.in/)
  * [Jaunt](https://www.jauntvr.com/get-the-app/)

Also, _every_ Youtube video can be viewed on Google Cardboard, so you're not going to
run out of content any time soon. But if you're looking for something a little
more exciting, come to the Lab and try out our HTC Vive.

##VR Journalism or Documentary film
* [Hunger in LA](http://www.immersivejournalism.com/hunger-in-los-angeles-machinima-video/)
Nonny de la Pe√±a's machinima video premiered at Sundance New Frontier in 2012 and
is widely credited with kicking off the current wave of interest in VR. (I couldn't find a
way to actually view the full project, so if you can, please make a PR)

* [My Mother's Wing](http://with.in/watch/my-mothers-wing/)
_My Mother's Wing_, available on the With.in app takes place in the Gaza Strip and tells
the story of a mother coping with the death of her two young children.

* [6x9](http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/apr/27/6x9-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement)
This piece from The Guardian takes you inside a solitary confinement cell inside and American prison.

##Other Story-centric VR projects
* [Giant](http://giantofficial.com/)
Milica Zec's _Giant_ is based on real events from her childhood in Serbia. The film is meant to be
viewed in stools equipped with rumble pads and isn't currently available for private viewing. If
you have the opportunity to go to a screening, don't miss it. The technique of live actors in a game
engine setting is really interesting.
