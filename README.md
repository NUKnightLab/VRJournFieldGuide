#Introduction

The VR Journalism Field Guide is a living document intended to grow as we continue to learn about the potential for virtual and augmented reality technology specifically within the field of journalism. The Field Guide is an Open project hosted at Northwestern University's Knight Lab. Contributions are encouraged.

We welcome you to contribute by making a pull request. Take a look at our Issues to see things we'd currently like help with. We're always interested in additions to our list of noteworthy VR journalism projects or hearing about new tools storytellers are using to create VR content. Have a question you'd like help answering? Go ahead and make an issue yourself.

The Field Guide is built with Gitbook. To run the Field Guide locally, fork or clone the repository. Then install the gitbook command by running npm install -g gitbook from your command line. From the root of the VRJournFieldGuide repo, run gitbook build . (this takes the gitbook markdown files and generates html for them) and gitbook build .. You should now have a local copy of the Field Guide running on http://localhost:4000/.
