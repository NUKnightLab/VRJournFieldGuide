# Where can I learn about VR?
This page is a list of people and Publications doing quality work _about_ VR. Feel
free to add your favorites as you discover them!

##VR Specific Publications
these publications only cover VR

* [Voices of VR](http://voicesofvr.com/)
  This podcast is an extremely ambitious effort to document the oral history of VR
  as it's happening. There's truly stunning amount of content here, covering a broad
  range of topics. You might want to start with [this list](http://voicesofvr.com/top-10-voices-of-vr-episodes-to-get-started-into-vr/)
  of the ten most popular episodes. Or just the [Pendleton Ward Episode](http://voicesofvr.com/410-stretching-the-boundaries-of-identity-in-vr-with-pendleton-ward/)
  because Pendleton Ward is awesome.
* [Versions](https://versions.killscreen.com/)
  Versions is the VR/AR arm of Kill Screen. They kind of think of themselves as
  "the Rolling Stone of Video Games". It's probably the least craft-oriented publication
  in this part of the list. They provide a lot of cultural context and can be a really
  good place to start.
* [There is Only One R](https://thereisonlyr.com)
  There is Only One R just started publishing on Medium in July and they're already
  producing some of the most thoughtful content out there. They're equally interested
  in thinking about these technologies from the perspective of both creators and users.
* [Haptic.al](https://haptic.al/)
  Haptic.al's weekly newsletter is a nice round up of VR news.


##Developer Blogs
creators documenting their process
* [The Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/)

* [The UX of VR](http://www.uxofvr.com/)
  Really robust and growing list of resources for UX/UI design in VR.
* [eleVR](http://elevr.com/)
  eleVR is a project of the Human Advancement Research Community. They open source
  all of their work product, liscense a bunch of 360 video under Creative Commons and
  blog about their process. eleVR is a great resource for when you're looking for a
  pretty deep dive--check out their [Spherical Cinematography 101](http://elevr.com/vr-editing-scale/)
